  "about_header1":"Matthieu Goar: This is one of the possible consequences of the crisis. Some sources within the macronia are beginning to evoke the possibility of a reshuffle in late August or early September. GÃ©rard Collomb is very weak from this crisis, because he dodged a lot of questions during his hearings before the two commissions of inquiry. But the most serious for him is his weakening among his men: the police force is very irritated by the Benalla affair. Many police officials do not understand that Mr. Benalla has become so important in organizing the president's security. If mistrust continues between the minister and the police, his future in the government will be complicated.",
 "about_header2":"Will this story weigh on Macron? We see discordant polls. Is it likely to influence future reform plans?",
 "about_content2":"It is far too early to say. These first polls do not mean much. On the other hand, the affair has already turned upside down the agenda of the reforms, since the constitutional revision, an important text, will be discussed at the beginning of the beginning or beginning of 2019. Mr. Macron still keeps the control of his quinquennium, but this affair risks to pursue him during his travels and in his relationship with the French. Most of our fellow citizens do not yet know this new president very well."
